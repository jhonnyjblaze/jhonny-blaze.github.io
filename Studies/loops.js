/**
* LOOPS AND ITERATION:
*
* Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.  In this guide we introduce the different iteration statements 
* available to JavaScript.  You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X 
* steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this 
* way as a loop:
*
* for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
*  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
*  console.log('Walking east one step');
* }
*
* There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.  
* (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!).  The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start 
* and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

// while statement
// The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true.  The 
// condition is evaluated before executing the statement.  A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition) {
  statement
}

// If the condition evaluates to false or falsey, the statement inside the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement 
// following the loop.  The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement 
// is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the 
// statement following while.

let result = '';
let i = -1;

while (i < 9) {
  i = i + 1;
  result = result + i;
}

console.log(result); // prints => "0123456789"

let result = '';
let i = 10;

while (i > 0) {
  i = i - 1;
  result = result + i;
}

console.log(result); // prints => "9876543210"

let result = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
let i = -1;

while (i < 9) {
  i = i + 1;
  console.log(result[i]); // prints => 0
}                         //           1
                          //           2
                          //           3

                           //           0


// The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than 3:

let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) { // true
  n++; // => n = 1
  x += n; // => x = 1
}

// After one iteration/loop

let n = 1;
let x = 1;
while (1 < 3) { // true
  1++; // => n = 2
  1 += n; // => x = 3
}

// After two iterations/loops

let n = 2;
let x = 3;
while (2 < 3) { // true
  2++; // => n = 3
  3 += n; // => x = 6
}

// After three iterations/loops

let n = 3;
let x = 6;
while (3 < 3) { // false: thus the while loop terminates (self-destructs) and the code block/statements stop executing
  3++;
  6 += n;
}


// Avoid infinite loops at all cost!  Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes falseâ€”otherwise, the loop will never terminate!  
// The statements in the following while loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false:

// Infinite loops are horrifying!
while (true) { // condition is always true
  console.log('Hello, world!'); // never stops printing (i.e. infinite loop)  => "Hello, world!"
}

// for statement
// The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement 
// (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop.  A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is 
// similar to the Java and C for loop.  A for statement looks as follows:

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression]) {
  statement
}

/*
When a for loop executes, the following occurs:

1.  The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an 
    expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
2.  The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, 
    the for loop terminates. (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
3.  The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
4.  If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
5.  Control returns to Step 2.

// Note: Arrays: Although it may be tempting to use this as a way to iterate over Array elements, the for...in statement will return 
// the name of your user-defined properties in addition to the numeric indexes.  Therefore, it is better to use a traditional for loop

// The following example shows the difference between a for...of loop and a for...in loop. While for...in iterates over property names, 
// for...of iterates over property values:
